# SOC

- this module is an implementation of the coulomb counting method as a process model to be used in a Kalman filter implementation.
- this module is a model used with in an overarching Kalman Filter algorithm as the prediction model. SOC estimations can be made from this model and another measurement/correction model can be made to correct the predictions made and thin out errors from both the measurement model and prediction model.
